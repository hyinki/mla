2024,May,I would give them zero stars!,I’d give zero stars if I could. I always see online that Singapore Airlines is one of the best airlines. But in my experience they are the worst I’ve ever flown on. I was humiliated and singled out on an outward flight by a flight attendant. Abused by a fellow passenger who wasprotected by the attendant regardless that I clearly was the victim. This was over a seat issue which on complaining to customer services at a later time they actually admitted that my seat was faulty!! As a female flying solo I avoided confrontation as I was flying long haul and would be alone at Changi on a layover for hours. I sadly had to fly home with the same airline later on. On the way back hoping to avoid anymore issues I paid for a particular seat only to find that I had been reassigned a seat when at the gate. The exact same seat as before!!! I explained the issue and the Singapore Airline staff member laughed at me! Not only did they take my extra seat booking money (they refused to refund the extra seat booking cost) I was humiliate ld once again by their staff! I would absolutely love to see them go under!…,1.0
2024,September,Very Poor service/responce,"Zero stars. Very disappointed with Singapore air. Not so much due to in flight issues, but from a customer service/policy standpoint. I had hundreds of thousands of air miles banked with the airline. These are miles I accumulated by spending hard earned money to receive. One dayI logged on to use the miles and they were gone. I called Singapore and they told me that the miles had expired. I did NOT receive a warnings about this and when the issue was looked into, I was simply told - sorry no miles anymore.   This is really  an insult. If you bank miles for future use with an airline, what gives them the ok to simply zero them out???   I will never fly with them again and I have pulled my company account as well.  I advise that you choose them wisely and look around for alternative travel.…",1.0
2024,October,Business Class of Singpore Airlines 2024,"Amazing, best service ever. Food is amazing, especially the starter and beef noodle soup. Very good, would recommend. The seat is also very comfy.",5.0
2024,October,10/10 for how they handled our delayed flight,"We had a 4.5 hour delay on our flight from London to Singapore, which we thought would make us miss our connecting flight to Brisbane.  Travelling with 2 kids under 10 on a 30+ hour journey and with a 4:00am start that day it was not the best news to wake up to. But SingaporeAirlines were faultless with how they handled it and the experience has reconfirmed why they are my first choice for long haul travel. Staff were helpful and knowledgeable, we were given support and assistance at every step and little details like noticing tired children so boarding us early (before first class!) made it more pleasant, not just for us but for our fellow passengers too. Cabin crew helped get us off the plane quickly so we could make our connection and ground staff were waiting for us with a buggy to whizz us straight to the gate so we made our next flight. It's easier to give good service when everything is running smoothly, so it's great to know you're in good hands when things aren't going to plan. Delays can't be helped but how they are handled makes all the difference.…",5.0
2024,October,Premium Economy,The leg room was great but the food was terrible. We traveled  on 5 Singapore Airlines Premium Economy flights on this trip. Service is patchy. No amenity packs given.
